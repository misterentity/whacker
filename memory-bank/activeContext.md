### Recently Completed ✅
- **ENHANCED: rar2fs Configuration & Management Interface** (July 15, 2025)
  - **New Features Added**:
    - ✅ **Service Management Controls**: Start/Stop/Restart rar2fs service
    - ✅ **Mount Management**: View active mounts, unmount all, open mount directory
    - ✅ **Advanced Configuration**: Timeout settings, auto-cleanup options
    - ✅ **Dependency Checking**: WinFSP service status, executable verification
    - ✅ **Log & Config Access**: Direct access to logs and configuration files
    - ✅ **Status Monitoring**: Real-time service and mount status display

    - ✅ Enhanced status displays with real-time updates
    - ✅ Silent auto-refresh on startup

- **RESOLVED: rar2fs Auto-Install Button Issue** (July 15, 2025)
  - **Root Cause**: Outdated download URLs in `rar2fs_installer.py` causing HTTP 404 errors
  - **Critical Discovery**: URLs were pointing to old versions (WinFSP v2.0 vs current v2.1+) 
  - **Resolution Applied**: 
    - ✅ Updated download URLs to use latest releases (`/releases/latest/download/`)
    - ✅ Added fallback URLs for better reliability  
    - ✅ Improved error handling and logging
    - ✅ Simplified installer architecture to remove complex Cygwin dependencies
    - ✅ Deployed fixed installer to installed directory (`C:\Program Files\PlexRarBridge\`)
  - **Verification**: Fixed installer now runs without HTTP 404 errors and properly detects system state

- **RESOLVED: Auto-Install Button Threading Issue** (July 15, 2025)
  - **Critical Bug**: `install_in_thread` function was defined but never called in `auto_install_rar2fs` method
  - **Fix Applied**: Added proper threading call with `install_thread.start()`
  - **Result**: Auto-Install rar2fs button now properly executes installation process
