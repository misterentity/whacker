# Active Context: Plex RAR Bridge Enhanced Edition

## Current Work Focus
Successfully completed upgrade installation of local PlexRarBridge installation.

## Recent Activity
- **rar2fs Installer Verification**: Comprehensive testing completed for rar2fs installer functionality
- **Admin Privilege Requirements**: Confirmed that rar2fs installation requires administrator privileges
- **Installation Upgrade**: Successfully upgraded local installation using manual file copy approach
- **Dependencies Updated**: Python dependencies upgraded to latest versions
- **Service Status**: PlexRarBridge Windows service running successfully after upgrade

## Latest Development: Installation Upgrade Completed
- **Verification Process**: Created and ran comprehensive tests for rar2fs installer functionality
- **Admin Requirements**: Confirmed that rar2fs installation needs administrator privileges for:
  1. **MSI Installation**: WinFSP installer requires system-wide MSI installation
  2. **Program Files Access**: Writing to C:/Program Files/ directory requires admin
  3. **Windows Services**: Installing/starting Windows services requires admin
  4. **Driver Installation**: WinFSP includes filesystem drivers requiring admin
- **Upgrade Method**: Used manual file copy approach after dependency installation failed
- **Current Status**: ✅ **Upgrade completed successfully**

## Installation Upgrade Results
- **Dependencies**: Updated to latest versions (requests 2.32.4, lxml 6.0.0, certifi 2025.7.14, cryptography 45.0.5, etc.)
- **Configuration Backup**: Created backup folder with previous configuration files
- **File Deployment**: All updated Python files copied to installation directory
- **rar2fs Installer**: Now available in installation directory for GUI use
- **Memory Bank**: Documentation copied to installation directory
- **Service Status**: PlexRarBridge service running (STATE: 4 RUNNING)

## Python VFS Status: ✅ WORKING
- **HTTP Server**: Running on port 8765 ✅
- **Database**: Properly initialized ✅
- **Configuration**: Synced between enhanced setup and main config ✅
- **Processing Mode**: python_vfs active ✅
- **UPnP Integration**: Working with port forwarding ✅
- **Mount Base**: Directory created and accessible ✅

## How Python VFS Works
- **RAR Archive Detection**: Files detected in watch directory
- **HTTP Server**: Serves files directly from RAR archives on port 8765
- **STRM File Creation**: Creates `.strm` files in Plex library directory
- **Plex Integration**: Plex reads `.strm` files and streams content via HTTP
- **No Extraction**: Archives remain compressed, saving disk space

## OMDB API Key Configuration
- **Added**: OMDB API key field to Enhanced Setup Panel
- **Location**: Plex Server Connection section
- **Features**: 
  - Secure input field (password-masked)
  - "Get Key" button that opens omdbapi.com
  - User-friendly instructions
  - Automatic configuration sync with FTP config
- **Configuration**: Saved to both enhanced_setup_config.json and ftp_config.json
- **Integration**: IMDbHelper class now reads from enhanced configuration

## User Feedback on Archive Organization
User provided actual folder structure example:
- **Path**: `/archive/x264-hd/6.Bullets.2012.1080p.BluRay.x264-UNVEiL`
- **Structure**: Archive directory contains subdirectories organized by release type
- **Organization**: Maintains hierarchical structure with release categories

## Current System State
- All TODOs are marked as completed
- System is fully functional with all fixes applied
- Enhanced Setup Panel now includes OMDB API key configuration
- FTP IMDb functionality fully integrated with GUI setup
- **Python VFS mode is working correctly**
- Database properly initialized
- Configuration files synchronized

## Next Steps
- User testing of Python VFS functionality
- Verification that .strm files are created correctly
- Confirm Plex can stream content from HTTP server
- Monitor for any issues with the enhanced integration

## Technical Notes
- Python VFS creates `.strm` files instead of extracting archives
- HTTP server runs on port 8765 with UPnP port forwarding
- STRM files contain URLs like `http://localhost:8765/movie_timestamp_filename.mkv`
- Plex streams content directly from RAR archives via HTTP
- No disk space required for extraction - archives stay compressed
- Configuration sync ensures enhanced setup and main config stay aligned
