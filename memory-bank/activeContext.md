- **RESOLVED: rar2fs Auto-Install Button Issue** (July 15, 2025)

  - **Critical Discovery**: URLs were pointing to old versions (WinFSP v2.0 vs current v2.1+) 
  - **Resolution Applied**: 
    - ‚úÖ Updated download URLs to use latest releases (`/releases/latest/download/`)
    - ‚úÖ Added fallback URLs for better reliability  
    - ‚úÖ Improved error handling and logging
    - ‚úÖ Simplified installer architecture to remove complex Cygwin dependencies

  - **Verification**: Fixed installer now runs without HTTP 404 errors and properly detects system state

- **RESOLVED: Auto-Install Button Threading Issue** (July 15, 2025)
  - **Critical Bug**: `install_in_thread` function was defined but never called in `auto_install_rar2fs` method
